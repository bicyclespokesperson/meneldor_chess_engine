Right now I'm losing the principal variation (when adding all eval types, not just exact), 
      might be due to TT overwrites:

Fancy magics? Might have better cache performance
  Implemented, appears slower unfortunately

Clean up stopping on stopSearch?

Make move generator aware of check?

Search
  Principle variation search
  Null move pruning // See laser, search "null move pruning"
  Move ordering
    Attack piece that most recently moved, first?
    SEE?

  Better quiescence search

      Use iterative deepening to order all moves, not just best move?

Implement insufficient material draws? Would this actually affect anything?

Should probably update create_build.sh to default to an out of source build, that would also make cleaning easier. 
Would need to see if there's a way to add make run or something to avoid CDing everywhere to run things
