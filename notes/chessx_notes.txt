To run an engine vs engine match in chessx (on mac)
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/chessx/

    Under preferences, set up both engines with their command and working direcotry
      Make sure to check the "Send history" box, otherwise the engines will sometimes draw by repetition
    Open analysis window 1 and analysis window 2 with the respective engines
    Analysis window 1 will play as white
    Make sure both engines are stopped
    Click game->engine match
    The default is time per move, not time for match
